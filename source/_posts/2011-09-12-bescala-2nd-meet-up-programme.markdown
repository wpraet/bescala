## Intro


**Louis Jacomet** [![]({{root.url}}/images/linkedin.png)](http://be.linkedin.com/in/ljacomet) [![]({{root.url}}/images/twitter.png)](http://twitter.com/#!/ljacomet)  
BeScala introduction and objectives.


## Lightning talks


**Tim Romberg** [![]({{root.url}}/images/linkedin.png)](http://be.linkedin.com/pub/tim-romberg/0/862/6a3)  
Short presentation of the Lift web framework, reporting on experience in creating a membership portal

**Renato Cavalcanti** [![]({{root.url}}/images/linkedin.png)](http://be.linkedin.com/in/renatocavalcanti) [![]({{root.url}}/images/twitter.png)](http://twitter.com/#!/irenato)  
Scala Guice is a thin layer on top of Google Guice that offers a more Scala like syntax.

Probabilistic Programming with Scala

Ozma is a conservative extension to Scala with Oz concurrency. Ozma adds dataflow values, lightweight threads, lazy execution and ports to Scala. Dataflow values, which are single-assignment values with automatic synchronization, are a very powerful language primitive for building concurrent software. They allow for declarative concurrency, a model in which concurrency is deterministic and explicit synchronization is not needed. In this talk, we present some of the most powerful programming techniques of Ozma with the help of some examples.

n-Side is using Scala to develop some of its applications. One of the main reasons for that is how easy it makes to create Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). In our business domain (mathematical optimization), developers are often writing their mathematical models in so-called modelling languages (e.g. AMPL), which typically lack the power of a true general-purpose programming language. On the other hand, general-purpose languages are often not expressive enough for this task. We use the power of Scala to design an internal DSL for optimization: Scampi (Scala Mathematical Programming Interface).

**Pierre Schaus** [![]({{root.url}}/images/linkedin.png)](http://be.linkedin.com/in/pschaus)  
Constraint Programming is an algorithmic approach to solve complex
combinatorial optimization problems.
We'll show how to describe and solve problems in Scala using our
state-of-the-art constraint programming solver.
The core implementation of the solver is in Java while the modelling
layer is in Scala.

**Bertrand Cornelusse**  
Roadeff (french operations research society) is organizing every two
years an optimization competition. We plan to take part this year to
the competition using the various modules of Scampi (n-Side's toolkit
to solve optimization problems) all implemented in Scala. We'll
shortly describe the problem proposed by Google and the high level
ideas we already found to solve it.

N-Side has an optimization tool called CT-Fast which contains a very heavy evaluation process. This program outputs the Pareto set (i.e. the set of optimal points in multiobjective optimization) for some given objectives by using many evaluations of the heavy process mentioned above. I implemented multiobjective optimization algorithms in Scala (I've never used it before) to use less evaluations and thus speed up the execution of the whole tool. The performance obtained are impressive and there is a good hope it can really improve the tool. I have some graphs and animations to show.


## Discussion Panel on Scala Adoption


With pizzas and drinks. :-)
