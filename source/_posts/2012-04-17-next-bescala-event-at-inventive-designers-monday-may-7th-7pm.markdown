The next BeScala event is scheduled for Monday May 7th at 7pm and we will have [Luc Duponcheel](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/luc-duponcheel/1/366/6b7) (@LucDup) presenting "Monads as Computations".

This talk deals with the monadic computation interface.
When implemented in Scala it can be used a DSL for approaching a whole range of computations in a uniform way.
This talk also shows how monads can be transformed to add extra computational features to them (while keeping their original (extra) computational features).

The following extra computational features will be demonstrated:

	
  * state

	
  * control (delimited continuations based)


In fact, the talk illustrates how to implement a monadic delimited continuations DSL without having to use an extra compiler plugin.
The resulting DSL is only slightly less concise than the one that makes use of the compiler plugin.

If there is some time left then also parallel programming with those monadic delimited continuations can be dealt with.

This BeScala meetup is generously hosted by **[Inventive Designers](http://www.inventivedesigners.com/)** in Antwerpen.


Please **[register](http://bescala.fikket.com/events/monads-as-computations/orders/new)** on the fikket page, as we have to limit participation.


Also, let us know if you have a change of plans, so we clan please others if needed.
