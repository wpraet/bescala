We have created two Google Calendars with all Devoxx' **Scala** talks and related topics.
	
  * [Scala @ Devoxx](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/bescala.org_phtoe0n1i1r2fpg1msnpfvb3do%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

        
  * [Other JVM lang](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/bescala.org_nfe8pqhn36qtmcne9b5orkj0no%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)



On the later, you'll find talks on Groovy, JRuby, Kotlin, Ceylon, Fantom, Java language updates and roadmap, the JavaPosse recording and a talk from Dick Wall about "Courage in Software Development". Considering his involvement with Scala, we can imagine that his talk is of interest to all of us.

You can download the .ics or import the url to you calendar application or Google Calendar.

The calendars are created by hand and may be out-of-sync. Therefore, don't forget to check the real one at [Devoxx 2011 Schedule](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Schedule).
