This Scala meetup is generously hosted by Inventive Designers in Antwerp.

7pm meet and greet

7:30pm presentations

The suggested topic for this meetup is "Scala for testing". Even if your team currently only uses Java for development, some of the Scala-based testing libraries (Specs, ScalaTest, ScalaCheck) that we plan to talk about are still an attractive solution, e.g. for BDD and Acceptance Testing, since they provide a strongly typed, IDE-assisted alternative to plain-text-based approaches for behaviour specification.

If you have any experience with Scala for testing, we'd like to hear about it.
