We are pleased to announce that our rendez-vous at [Devoxx 2012](http://www.devoxx.com/) is confirmed.

Come and join us on Monday 12th November at 19:00 on the [Scala Enthusiasts Gathering BoF](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Scala+Enthusiasts+Gathering) for a informal meet-up with other Scala enthusiasts from Belgium and abroad.

The access to the BoFs are **free of charge**, but of course we **strongly** **recommend** a Devoxx subscription.Â As usual, Devoxx is featuring a lot of excellent [talks](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Schedule), some of them on [Scala](http://www.devoxx.com/label/DV12/scala).

Don't wait till the last minute, get today your Devoxx [subscription](https://reg.devoxx.com/public/#DV12).
