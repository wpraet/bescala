We are pleased to announce that we'll be present at [Devoxx 2011](http://www.devoxx.com/) with the "[Scala Enthusiasts Gathering](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Scala+Enthusiasts+Gathering)" BoF.

Come and join us on Monday 14th at 20:00 for a informal meet-up with other Scala enthusiasts from Belgium and abroad.

The access to the BoFs are **free of charge**, but of course we **strongly** **recommend** a Devoxx subscription.

For those who were living on another planet and don't know [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.com/)Â yet, it is the biggest and best Java conference outside the US (some says it's already the best in the world). And it takes place just next door, in Antwerpen.

As usual, Devoxx is featuring a lot of excellent [talks](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Schedule), some of them on [Scala](http://www.devoxx.com/label/DV11/scala).

Don't wait till the last minute, get today your Devoxx [subscription](https://reg.devoxx.com/).
