So, here is our website and its first post!

**BeScala**, the** Belgium Scala Enthusiasts** website was born after the first **Belgium Scala Meetup** hold on July 13th, 2011 in Brussels.

Here we'll share information about our future meetups, presentations, drinks and all activities related with the Scala programming language in Belgium.

To keep informed about our activity, follow us on: Twitter ([@be_scala](https://twitter.com/#!/be_scala)), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=4001883&trk=anet_ug_hm) and/or [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/bescala).
And of course this website!
