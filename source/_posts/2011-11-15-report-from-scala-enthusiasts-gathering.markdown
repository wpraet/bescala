Yesterday, we had the "Scala Enthusiats Gathering" BoF at Devoxx. We had between 20 to 30 attendees, some beer and some very interesting discussions about Scala. Most of the attendees were from Europe and Scala experience varied from none to full time Scala developers. We even had a Typesafe employee joining us. :-)

One of the most discussed topic was Scala adoption and how to introduce it at work. As usual the most proposed strategy was to introduce it via non-produciton code, such as testing or support tools (build, deployment, log analysis, etc).

Concerning Scala in production for mixed projects (Java + Scala), one of the proposed approachs was to have Java interfaces implemented in Scala or avoiding Scala methods with functions as parameters if they are to be called from Java.

During the session some of the attendees gave links to their projects on github that could be useful for those willing to learn more about Scala. The list can be found bellow.
