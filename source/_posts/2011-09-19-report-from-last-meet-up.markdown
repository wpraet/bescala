Last week we had our second meet-up with some very interesting Lightning talks, pizzas and beer! What could a Scala enthusiast ask more? :-)

Some of the presentations are available on slideshare.

We would like to thanks [n-side](http://www.n-side.be/) once again for hosting our meet-up and supporting our group. And for sponsoring the pizzas and drinks. :-)

We have also some fresh news for our small community that we'll be announced in the coming days. So, stay tuned...

And to finalize, a small quote from one of last week speakers. We think that his sentence express a lot our feelings about Scala.

_"I used to programme in Python and Ruby. Then, for work, I had to use Java. Now, with Scala, I'm free again."_
