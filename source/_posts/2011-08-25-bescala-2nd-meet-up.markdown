We'll have limited places (maximum 25 people). Therefore, make sure you subscribe on Fikket if you want to join us.
And if for any reason you cannot join, let us know so we can invite people from the wait list.

For this time we would like to organize Lightning talks. Feel free to come talk about your Scala passion and show/tell us what you have been coding in Scala.
The talks will be 5 minutes in length. See for reference: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk)

We also would like to organize a discussion panel about Scala adoption in Belgium. So, if you have ideas, plans/strategies or experience introducing Scala in your company, we are very interested to hear your story. ;-)

And last but not least, a special thanks to the N-SIDE management and in particular to Ciprian Mocanu and Gilles Scouvart for supporting our initiative.
