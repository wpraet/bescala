## **SOLD OUT! **


During this Dojo we'll implement a Play! 2.0 application in Scala.

We'll start if a simple CRUD application where we'll get in touch with basic usage of forms, page template, database persistence and testing in Play!. If time allows we'll go for more advanced features and implement some functionality using Akka.

This BeScala meetup is generously hosted by **[AE](http://www.ae.be)** in Leuven.

**What is a coding dojo?**


A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there have fun and to engage in Deliberate Practice in order to improve their skills. [http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo)
